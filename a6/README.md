Assignment 6 :

Overview:
Because the Professor said it was ok with him as long as he can test the requirements and such,
I ended up implementing the entire project on my own without utilizing his starter code
because of this the gui is completely different from his.
But it still does everything as required!! :)



INSTRUCTIONS:


before doing the initial run, you should run "make" and close the application,
from here run "make createDatabase" and "make populateEmp" 
This will reformat the database if the one youre using isnt properly formatted and add example values for testing the core functionality and requirements.


then run "make" again, everything should be working for checking all the requirements.
